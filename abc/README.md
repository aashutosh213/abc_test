# Class Management System

This project is made by **Aashutosh Tiwari**.

## Getting Started

Before running the project, always start by installing the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages to run the application.

## Running the Project

To start the project in development mode, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will launch the backend server.

## Frontend for Visualization

Since the time was limited and I couldn't dedicate as many hours as I wanted, I have compensated by creating a small **Class Management Frontend** for visualizing classes.

### Running the Frontend
To run the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, start the React frontend:

```sh
npm start
```

## Backend & Frontend on Separate Ports
The backend and frontend are hosted on **two different ports**, allowing hassle-free access to both.
